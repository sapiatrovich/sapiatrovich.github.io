			<p>Hello! I am Samuel Artsiomavich Piatrovich, but for simplicities sake it is better to call me Sam. I was born in England, but after a year my parents moved to Belarus. I grew up in Belarus and only visited England every other year.  There are six members in our family including me. There’s my mum and dad, me, two younger brothers, and Jessie the dog. I grew up in a small town and hours away from the capital and went to the same school for eleven years, through primary school to high school. During those eleven years, I also attended an art college for five years and got an “applied arts” degree. Going to this college was quite a strain, as it would take up a lot of time after school five days a week. It wasn’t my idea and initiative to attend it, rather my mothers. While in beginning I didn’t like it, I became fond of it at some point and thankful to mum. After school and Art College I applied to several universities and got into LCC International University. Here, my major is Contemporary Communication and I am currently a sophomore with responsibilities of a DA. I have hobbies like going to the gym, drawing, and recently Web designing while learning front-end development. Unfortunately due to health and time restraints I am not able to do the first two. I am hoping to finish my studies at LCC and find a job that would allow me to travel the world.</p>
